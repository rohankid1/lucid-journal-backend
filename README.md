# lucid-journal-backend
This is a simple backend, made in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) & [Actix Web](https://actix.rs).

This is part of my project which can be found here:

# Building/Running
To build the source code, make sure to install the Rust language first.

Then, run:
* `cargo r -r` - `-r` is short for `--release`.
Omit `-r` if you are using it in development and not production.

For building an executable, run:
* `cargo b -r` or `cargo b`
